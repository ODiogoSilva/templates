"""
Purpose
-------

This module is intended parse the results of FastQC for paired end FastQ \
samples. It parses two reports:

    - Categorical report
    - Nucleotide level report.

Expected input
--------------

The following variables are expected whether using NextFlow or the
:py:func:`main` executor.

- ``fastq_id`` : Sample identification string
    - e.g.: ``'SampleA'``

- ``result_p1`` : Path to both FastQC result files for pair 1
    - e.g.: ``'SampleA_1_data SampleA_1_summary'``

- ``result_p2`` : Path to both FastQC result files for pair 2
    - e.g.: ``'SampleA_2_data SampleA_2_summary'``

Generated output
----------------

The generated output are output files that contain an object, usually a string.

- ``fastqc_health`` : Stores the health check for the current sample. If it
    passes all checks, it contains only the string 'pass'. Otherwise, contains
    the summary categories and their respective results
    - e.g.: ``'pass'``
- ``optimal_trim`` : Stores a tuple with the optimal trimming positions for 5'
    and 3' ends of the reads.
    - e.g.: ``'15 151'``

    Provided with a list of ``bool`` elements (``[False, False, True, True]``),
    this function will assess the index of the list that minimizes the number
    of True elements (biased positions) at the extremities. To do so,
    it will iterate over the boolean list and find an index position where
    there are two consecutive ``False`` elements after a ``True`` element. This
    will be considered as an optimal trim position. For example, in the
    following list::

        [True, True, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, ...]

    The optimal trim index will be the 4th position, since it is the first
    occurrence of a ``True`` element with two False elements after it.

    If the provided ``bool`` list has no ``True`` elements, then the 0 index is
    returned.
