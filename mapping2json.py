"""
Purpose
-------

This module is intended to generate a json output for mapping results that
can be imported in pATLAS.

Expected input
--------------

The following variables are expected whether using NextFlow or the
:py:func:`main` executor.

- ``depth_file`` : String with the name of the mash screen output file.
    - e.g.: ``'samtoolsDepthOutput_sampleA.txt'``
- ``json_dict`` : the file that contains the dictionary with keys and values for
        accessions and their respective lengths.
    - e.g.: ``'reads_sample_result_length.json'``
- ``cutoff`` : The cutoff used to trim the unwanted matches for the minimum
        coverage results from mapping. This value may range between 0 and 1.
    - e.g.: ``0.6``

    '''
    Function that parse samtools depth file and creates 3 dictionaries that
    will be useful to make the outputs of this script, both the tabular file
    and the json file that may be imported by pATLAS

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth_file: str
        the path to depth file for each sample

        a dictionary that stores length of all plasmids in fasta given as input
